## Objectives
* Analyze customer purchase behavior using transaction and customer behavior datasets.
* Evaluate the performance of trial store layouts compared to control stores.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to improve business strategies.

## Datasets
* QVI_transaction_data.csv: Contains transaction data including date, store number, product number, etc.
* QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv: Contains customer behavior data including customer ID, loyalty status, etc.

## Methodology

### Task 1: Customer Analytics
1. **Data Cleaning:**
* Convert date columns to datetime format.
* Remove irrelevant categories (e.g., salsas).
* Handle outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
*  Analyze total sales by different customer segments (e.g., LIFESTAGE, MEMBER_TYPE).
* Identify top contributing segments to total sales.
* Analyze purchase patterns such as preferred brands and pack sizes for specific segments.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**
* Perform Pearson correlations to understand relationships between variables.
* Use magnitude distances or other metrics to compare segments.

### Task 2: Uplift Testing
1. **Store Comparison:**

* Identify benchmark (control) stores for each trial store.
* Compare total sales and customer metrics between trial and control stores.

2. **Hypothesis Testing:**

* Conduct statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences in performance between trial and control stores.
* Analyze results for each trial store over different time periods.

### Task 3: Reporting
1. **Report Preparation:**
* Use the Pyramid Principle to structure the report, starting with key insights and supporting details.
* Create visualizations to illustrate findings.
* Summarize recommendations based on the analysis.





## About Me

ðŸš€ About Me
Hi! I'm a passionate student currently diving deep into Machine Learning and Data Science. I'm enrolled in a Data Science bootcamp where I'm building real-world projects to apply what I learnâ€”from data wrangling and visualization to model building and evaluation.

My goal is to become a data scientist who not only understands algorithms but also solves meaningful problems with data. I love working on practical applications and constantly seek opportunities to improve my skills through hands-on experience.

ðŸ“Š Tools & Topics Iâ€™m exploring: Python â€¢ Pandas â€¢ NumPy â€¢ Scikit-learn â€¢ Matplotlib â€¢ SQL â€¢ Deep Learning
